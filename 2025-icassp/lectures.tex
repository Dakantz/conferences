\textbf{Diversity{-}Seeking Techniques for Red{-}Teaming LLMs} & \url{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10890844/} & Add RL{-}Loss to train similar to GAN by backpropagating if the model returns very similar output (i.e. discrimimnator){-}> Very fragile learning;  Limited further studies\\ 
\hline 
\textbf{FDR Control for Complex{-}Valued Data} & \url{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10889705} & similar to LASSO; sparsifying system under certain guarantees\\ 
\hline 
\textbf{SpectralCam: High{-}Resolution Low{-}Cost Spectral Imaging Using DSLR Cameras} & \url{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10887725} & Interesting concept of applying photo filter to DSLR sensor, Bayesian pattern restoration "learned" using diffusion \& attenuation mtx\\ 
\hline 
\textbf{Fusing Multimodality of Large Language Models and Satellite Imagery} & \url{https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10889624} & Could be interesting in combination with HEREDITARY geospatial data once we have access\\ 
\hline 
\textbf{Controllable Forgetting Mechanism for Few{-}Shot Class{-}Incremental Learning} & \url{https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15998} & Using embedding space to classify, add new classifier based on distance, seems rather hyperparameter{-}sensitive\\
